# LIVE-HFR Database
We provide two ways of downloading LIVE-HFR database: using command line and manual download. We recommend using command line as it is easier and can download and unzip the entire database.

## Usage
Linux and Mac users run the following commands in the directory where the database is to be downloaded. Use the password mailed to you when prompted while unzipping the downloaded files. Please ensure there is atleast ~250GB space available before downloading.

Windows users can run the following commands
