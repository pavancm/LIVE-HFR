# Subjective Scores

There are two files containing subjective data
1. subject_MOS.csv - contains Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) and their respective standard deviation obtained from 85 subjects in a laboratory environment. The file is arranged with filenames associated with their MOS and standard deviation. MOS was calculated after rejecting unreliable subjects.

2. subject_raw.csv - contains raw scores provided by 85 subjects. The entries with -1 indicate the video was not rated by that particular subject.
